## When people find out I write about time management, they assume two things. One isthat I'm always on time, and I'm not. I havefour small children, and I would like to blamethem for my occasional tardiness, butsometimes it's just not their fault. I was oncelate to my own speech on time management.We all had to just take a moment together andsavor that irony.

2 The second thing they assume is that I have lots of tips and tricks for saving bits of time here and there. Sometimes I'll hear from magazines that are doing a story along these lines, generally on how to help their readers find an extra hour in the day. And the idea isthat we'll shave bits of time off everyday activities, add it up, and we'll have time for thegood stuff. I question the entire premise of thispiece, but I'm always interested in hearing what they've come up with before they callme. Some ofmy favorites: doing errands where you only have to make right-hand turns.Being extremely judicious in microwaveusage: it says three to three-and-a-half minuteson the package, we're totally getting in on the bottom side of that.

3 And my personal favorite, which makes senseon some level, is to DVR your favorite showsso you can fast-forward through thecommercials. That way, you save eightminutes every half hour, so in the course oftwo hours of watching TV, you find 32minutes to exercise.Which is true. You knowanother way to find 32 minutes to exercise?Don't watch two hours ofTV a day, right?

4 Anyway, the idea is we'll save bits of time here and there, add it up, we will finally get to every thing we want to do. But after studying how successful people spend their time and looking at their schedules hour by hour, Ithink this idea has it completely backward. Wedon't build the lives we want by saving time.We build the lives we want, and then timesaves itself

5 Here's what I mean. I recently did a time diary project looking at 1,001 days in the lives ofextremely busy women. They had demandingjobs, sometimes their own businesses, kids tocare for, maybe parents to care for,community commitments --busy, busypeople. I had them keep track of their time fora week so I could add up how much theyworked and slept, and I interviewed themabout their strategies, for my book.

6 One of the women whose time log I studiedgoes out on a Wednesday night for somethingShe comes home to find that her water heaterhas broken, and there is now water all overher basement.

7 If you've ever had anything like this happen toyou, you know it is a hugely damaging,frightening, sopping mess. So she's dealingwith the immediate aftermath that night, nextday she's got plumbers coming in, day afterthat, professional cleaning crew dealing withthe ruined carpet. All this is being recorded onher time log. Winds up taking seven hours ofher week.Seven hours. That's like finding anextra hour in the day.

8 But I'm sure if you had asked her at the start ofthe week, "Could you find seven hours to trainfor a triathlon?" "Could you find seven hoursto mentor seven worthy people?" I'm sure shewould've said what most of us would've said,which is, "No -- can't you see how busy I am?Yet when she had to find seven hours becausethere is water all over her basement, she foundseven hours. And what this shows us is thattime is highly elastic.We cannot make moretime, but time will stretch to accommodatewhat we choose to put into it.

9 And so the key to time management is treatingour priorities as the equivalent of that brokenwater heater. To get at this, I like to uselanguage from one of the busiest people I evelinterviewed. By busy, I mean she was runninga small business with 12 people on the payrollshe had six children in her spare time. I wasgetting in touch with her to set up an interviewon how she "had it all" -- that phrase. Iremember it was a Thursday morning, and shewas not available to speak with me. Of course,right?

10 But the reason she was unavailable to speakwith me is that she was out for a hike, becauseit was a beautiful spring morning, and shewanted to go for a hike. So of course thismakes me even more intrigued, and when Tfinally do catch up with her, she explains itlike this. She says, "Listen Laura, everything do, every minute I spend, is my choice." Andrather than say, "I don't have time to do x, y orZ," she'd say, "I don't do x, y or z because it'snot a priority." "I don't have time," oftenmeans "It's not a priority." If you think aboutit, that's really more accurate language.Icould tell you I don't have time to dust myblinds, but that's not true. If you offered topay me $100,000 to dust my blinds, I wouldget to it pretty quickly.

11 Since that is not going to happen, I canacknowledge this is not a matter of lackingtime; it's that I don't want to do it. Using thislanguage reminds us that time is a choice.And granted, there may be horribleconsequences for making different choices, lwill give you that. But we are smart people,and certainly over the long run, we have thepower to fill our lives with the things thatdeserve to be there.

12 So how do we do that? How do we treat ourpriorities as the equivalent of that broken water heater?

13 Well, first we need to figure out what theyare.I want to give you two strategies forthinking about this. The first, on theprofessional side: I'm sure many peoplecoming up to the end of the year are givingor getting annual performance reviews. Youlook back over your successes over the yearyour "opportunities for growth." And thisserves its purpose, but I find it's moreeffective to do this looking forward. So Iwant you to pretend it's the end of next year.You're giving yourself a performance review,and it has been an absolutely amazing yearfor you professionally. What three to fivethings did you do that made it so amazing'So you can write next year's performancereview now.

14 And you can do this for your personal lifetoo.I'm sure many of you, like me, comeDecember, get cards that contain thesefolded up sheets of colored paper, on whichis written what is known as the familyholiday letter.

15 Bit of a wretched genre of literature, really,going on about how amazing everyone in thehousehold is, or even more scintillating, howbusy everyone in the household is. But theseletters serve a purpose, which is that they tel!your friends and family what you did in yourpersonal life that mattered to you over theyear. So this year's kind of done, but I wantyou to pretend it's the end of next year, and ithas been an absolutely amazing year for youand the people you care about.

16 What three to five things did you do thatmade it so amazing? So you can write nextyear's family holiday letter now. Don't send1t.

17 Please, don't send it. But you can write it.And now, between the performance reviewand the family holiday letter, we have a listof six to ten goals we can work on in thenext year.

18 And now we need to break these down intodoable steps. So maybe you want to write afamily history. First, you can read someother family histories, get a sense for thestyle. Then maybe think about the questionsyou want to ask your relatives, set upappointments to interview them.Or maybeyou want to run a $K. So you need to find arace and sign up, figure out a training plan,and dig those shoes out of the back of thecloset. And then -- this is key -- we treat ourpriorities as the equivalent of that brokenwater heater, by putting them into ourschedules first. We do this by thinkingthrough our weeks before we are in them.

19 I find a really good time to do this is Fridayafternoons. Friday afternoon is what aneconomist might call a "low opportunitycost" time. Most of us are not sitting there onFriday afternoons saying, "I am excited tomake progress toward my personal andprofessional priorities right now."But we arewilling to think about what those should be.

20 So take a little bit of time Friday afternoon.make yourself a three-category priority list:career, relationships, self. Making a three-category list reminds us that there should besomething in all three categories.

21 Career, we think about, relationships, self--not so much. But anyway, just a short list, twoto three items in each. Then look out over thewhole of the next week, and see where youcan plan them in.

22 Where you plan them in is up to you.I knowthis is going to be more complicated for somepeople than others. I mean, some people'slives are just harder than others. It is not goingto be easy to find time to take that poetry classif you are caring for multiple children on yourown. I get that. And I don't want to minimizeanyone's struggle. But I do think that thenumbers I am about to tell you are empowering

23 There are 168 hours in a week. Twenty-fourtimes seven is 168 hours. That is a lot of time.If you are working a full-time job, so 40 hoursa week, sleeping eight hours a night, so 56hours a week -- that leaves 72 hours for otherthings. That is a lot of time. You say you'reworking 50 hours a week, maybe a main joband a side hustle. Well, that leaves 62 hoursfor other things. You say you're working 60hours. Well, that leaves 52 hours for otherthings. You say you're working more than 60hours. Well, are you sure?

24 There was once a study comparing people'sestimated work weeks with time diaries.They found that people claiming 75-plus-hour work weeks were off by about 25 hours.

25 You can guess in which direction, right?Anyway, in 168 hours a week, I think we canfind time for what matters to you. If you wantto spend more time with your kids, you wantto study more for a test you're taking, youwant to exercise for three hours and volunteerfor two, you can. And that's even if you'reworking way more than full-time hours.

26 So we have plenty of time, which is great,because guess what? We don't even need thatmuch time to do amazing things. But whenmost of us have bits of time, what do we do?Pull out the phone, right? Start deletingemails. Otherwise, we're puttering around thehouse or watching TV But small momentscan have great power. You can use your bitsof time for bits of joy. Maybe it's choosing toread something wonderful on the bus on theway to work.

27 I know when I had a job that required twobus rides and a subway ride every morning,used to go to the library on weekends to getstuff to read. It made the whole experiencealmost, almost, enjoyable. Breaks at workcan be used for meditating or praying. Iffamily dinner is out because of your craZywork schedule, maybe family breakfast couldbe a good substitute.

28 It's about looking at the whole of one's timeand seeing where the good stuff can go. I trulybelieve this. There is time. Even if we arebusy, we have time for what matters. Andwhen we focus on what matters, we can buildthe lives we want in the time we've got.
